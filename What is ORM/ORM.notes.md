# ORM :

* ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.

* The ORM allows to use Objects instead of using straight SQL queries to work with database and tables .

* The Object Relational Mapping ( ORM ) improves the readability of code , understanding better because it consisits of properties and values format of data.

## Advantages of ORM :

* ORM's create a structure for CRUD operations for database.

* This improves the readability , documentation and speed of development .

* This makes getting data very easy.

* It gives protection while interacting with the SQL injections. A good ORM framework will defenitely allow to Use raw `SQL queries` in some cases but the bad ORM framework wont.

* It is Type Safety.

## Disadvantages of ORM :

* Code First approach :

  * Code first databases may cause threat on the database while migrating the data.

  * This approach is only fine untill other applications /data tools need to interact to yor DataBase.

* It tightly couples our application logic with stored data. It leads the migration hard between database tables.

* Some ORM's make raw SQL hard.
